# Engaging Engineers.SG

## For recording meetups

Our community initiative is fully operated by volunteers and we provide video recording for meetups free of charge.

The criteria for recording your meetup includes the following:

1. Your meetup must be of a technical nature or has something to do with startups.
2. Most of your presenters are comfortable with being recorded and the videos published online.
3. Your venue provider / sponsor is okay with video recording being done at ther meetup area.
4. We have volunteers available and they expressed interest in recording your meetup.

If you feel your meetup fulfills the first 3 criterias, you can proceed to request for our support:

1. Email us at **bookings@engineers.sg** with detail about your event.
2. Update our online schedule with your event details: [https://bit.ly/esg-schedule](https://bit.ly/esg-schedule).

We will check with our volunteers on their availablilty. Once a volunteer is assigned, we shall inform you of their contact details.

On the day of the meetup, the volunteer will proceed to the meetup venue with our recording equipment.

We request your understanding and cooperation with our volunteer:

- The volunteer should arrive at least half an hour before the start time of your meetup. Please do not start the meetup before they are ready with the setup.
- The volunteer will need time to setup their equipment. Do have your presenter's laptops ready to check on compatibility with our system. Typically, the setup should take between 15 to 30 minutes.
- After the recording is done, the volunteer will need time to tear down the setup.
- The videos will be uploaded as soon as the volunteer is able to they will be published on the Engineers.SG website as well as our YouTube Channel.
- Do inform our volunteer:
	- If you need additional clearance before we can publish the videos.
	- If some speakers do not wish to be recorded.

In the same spirit, we will charge a small fee for recording your conference.

Community discounts are available upon request.

In addition to the things in the meetup recording, conference recordings will also have these features:

- Customized background images in line with your conference branding.
- Pre-roll or post-roll videos can be added to the videos (to be provided by the conference team).
- We can upload the video to your YouTube Channel.
- We can also do live streams of events upon request.
