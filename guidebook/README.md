## Setup Procedure

1. Find a suitable location to setup the recording equipment.
	- Take note of where the video cable for the projector is located.
	- Take note of where the nearest power socket is located (relative to the video cable).
	- Does the venue have a table for you to place your equipment? If not, get a stable chair.

2. Setup power strip.

3. Setup the HDMI splitter + HDMI cables.
	- This is so that presenter & organizers can check that their laptops are compatible with our setup as well as the projector's resolution.
	- If its not realistic to keep the splitter on the equipment organizer, just remove it and position it near the speaker + video cable for the projector.

4. 	Place the laptop (do not switch on yet) and connect the charger (start the power).
5. Setup the tripod + webcam.
6. Setup the equipment organizer.
	- Connect all the USB cables (blue, green & brown dot) to the laptop.
	- Connect the micro USB charger to the wireless microphone receiver.
	- Connect the HDMI cable to the screen capture device (if the splitter is not on the blue platform).
7. Setup the wireless microphone transmitter.
	- Attach the lapel microphone.
	- Switch on and check battery level (at the receiver).
	- The audio interface should also light up (green LED ring around the audio knob) when you speak into the microphone.

8. Start the laptop & start OBS Studio.
9. Check that you have a good capture.
	- Ensure that you are getting video feed from the webcam, screen capture device (ensure a laptop is connected for presentation).
	- Ensure that you are getting a good audio feed from the wireless lapel microphone (green audio level bar should hover around 50-80% when presenter is speaking).
10. Try a test recording & verify that you can produce the video file.


## Start Recording

### To start:

Launch OBS Studio by double-clicking on the black logo that looks like a fan on the desktop.

### Before you start:

- Help the presenter to wear the wireless microphone.
- Help the presenter to connect their laptop to the recording system. We only use HDMI - find a suitable adapter if the presenter's laptop does not have HDMI output. Make sure his presentation is projected on the screen and captured in our recording setup.
- Is the screen capture okay and reflects what is currently on the projector screen?
- Is the video feed okay? Move your hands in front of the camera to see motion.
- Is the audio levels okay? Ensure the levels stays in the green and yellow zone.
- Optional - but good to try before any of the presenters start:
	- You can try to record a short clip to see if it records properly. Playback the video to check the audio levels and screen motion.

### Start recording:

- Click on "Start Recording" to start recording. It is okay to start a little earlier and capture a few seconds before he starts - better to have more footage than miss out something.
- Ensure that the screen capture did not freeze throughout the presentation.
- Check on the file size - ensure itâ€™s growing.

### During presentation:

- Make sure the presenter is always in view in the video feed. Follow him with the Webcam if he moves around.
- Change scenes appropriately to focus on the presentation or the speaker.
- Usually for Q&A session, use the "Video Only" scene.

### End of presentation:

After the presentation (and perhaps the Q&A session), do remember to stop the recording.
Retrieve the wireless mic from the speaker. You can also help to disconnect the HDMI cable 
Remember to click on 'Start Recording" again before each speaker starts.
